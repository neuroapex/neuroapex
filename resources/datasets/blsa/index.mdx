  The National Institute on Aging’s Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)
  is America's longest-running scientific study of human aging. It began in
  1958, when gerontology—the study of aging—was still very much in its infancy.
  Today, the BLSA is world-renowned, having generated thousands of scientific
  papers and made major contributions to our understanding of what it means to
  get older.
