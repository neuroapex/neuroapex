<p>Nineteen-channel EEG was recorded with closely spaced electrodes overlaying the left sensorimotor cortex during self-paced, voluntary right finger movements. Three right-handed people served as subjects. The EEG was analysed in the 10 Hz band (10-12 Hz) and in four 40 Hz bands (34-36, 36-38, 38-40, 40-42) by calculation of ERD time courses and ERD maps, whereby a ERD is characterized by a movement-related band power decrease. In all three subjects a close to C3 localized 10 Hz ERD was found, starting about 2 s prior to movement onset and continuing during movement. Along with this 10 Hz ERD a localized and short-lasting (about 0.5 s) burst of 40 Hz oscillations was embedded around movement onset. This can be interpreted as indicating that planning of movement is accompanied by a desynchronization of central mu rhythm and a generation of 40 Hz oscillations.</p>
