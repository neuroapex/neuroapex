abstract: Introduction. The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. ADNI-3, which began on August 1, 2016, is a 5-year renewal of the current ADNI-2 study. Methods. ADNI-3 will follow current and additional subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD using innovative technologies such as tau imaging, magnetic resonance imaging sequences for connectivity analyses, and a highly automated immunoassay platform and mass spectroscopy approach for cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis. A Systems Biology/pathway approach will be used to identify genetic factors for subject selection/enrichment. Amyloid positron emission tomography scanning will be standardized using the Centiloid method. The Brain Health Registry will help recruit subjects and monitor subject cognition. Results. Multimodal analyses will provide insight into AD pathophysiology and disease progression. Discussion. ADNI-3 will aim to inform AD treatment trials and facilitate development of AD disease-modifying treatments. Keywords. Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid phenotyping; Brain Health Registry; Centiloid method; Clinical trial biomarkers; Functional connectivity; Tau imaging.
